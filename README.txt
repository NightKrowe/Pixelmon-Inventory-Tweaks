# Pixelmon-Inventory-Tweaks
Add the Pixelmon Mod to your sorting file for Inventory Tweaks in Minecraft.


This work has been compiled by me as a personal quality of life addition to Pixelmon. I felt that I should share it so it can be used by anyone.
I do not claim any part of the forestry mod or pixelmon mod as my own. Sources for the item list comes from the pixelmon wiki.

Hopefully there are not mistakes, but if you find any... let me know! This is work in progress. Please be patient.
